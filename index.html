      <p>This is a basic overview of the lore of League of Legends</p>
    </div>
    <p>Runeterra consists of 2 currently known continents, Valoran and Shurima, as well as a plethora of large bodies of water such as the 18 seas and 2 oceans.</p>
    <p>Magic plays an important part in the history and formation of Runeterra. There are two main kinds of magic that exist, primary magic and combined magic. Beings can be born or created with different levels of magic. Magic non-native to the individuals can still be used through the use of special techniques or magical artifacts.</p>
    <p>There are currently 3 primary types of magic known: celestial, elemental, and spirit. Celestial magic is magic that comes from celestial concepts known as aspects and world runes. Elemental magic is magic that allows the control of elemental power in the material realm. There are a wide variety of base elemental magic such as: magma, nature, water, time, and light. Spirit magic is magic that comes from the spirit realm. It is able to distort reality, distort the perception of reality, and harness the energies of a soul. There is a demonic offshoot of spirit magic known as shadow magic which is primarily used by members of the shadow order and demons such as nocturne.</p>
    <p>Primary types of magic can combine to form 4 basic types of combined magic. These are ascended, hemomancy, hextech, and runic magic. Ascended magic, which is celestial and elemental magic combined, is requred in the creation of ascended beings. Some of its key abilities are to reshape physical forms, prolong lifespans, greatly empower and expand the base abilities of an individual, and create a connection between Ascended beings and the Aspects. Hemomancy, which is elemental and spirit magic, is largely used by the Darkin, and later on by the Crimson Circle, the followers of Vladimir. It can also reshape physical forms and prolong lifespans however it can also absorb the life essence of a living being, and manipulate blood. Hextech magic, which is elemental and spirit magic combined with technology, was invented and largely used in Piltover. One of its abilities is to animate or empower technological devices as a fuel source. Runic magic is also celestial and elemental magic. It is often used in conjunction with the world runes.</p>
